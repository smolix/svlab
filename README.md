Ancient SVM code in Matlab

This is an old Matlab toolbox that I wrote over two decades ago, mainly for my own purpose. Some early versions have been released 
and the code is now completely unmaintained. It may not even run on a recent version of MATLAB any more. I 
abandoned the work after the Mathworks increased the price for a license by a factor of 10 because they d
ecided to classify NICTA as an industrial research lab. Please do not ask me for help with bugfixes or instructions. 
The code is provided as is.
